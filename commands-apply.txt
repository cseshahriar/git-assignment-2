Copy code
echo "# Git Assignment 2" > README.md
Make an Initial Commit:

bash
Copy code
git add README.md
git commit -m "Initial commit: Added README.md"

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin <remote_repository_url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Create and Switch to Feature-1 Branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature-1
Make Changes on Feature-1: Add or modify files. Example:

bash
Copy code
echo "Feature 1 content" > feature1.txt
git add feature1.txt
git commit -m "Feature-1: Added feature1.txt"
Switch Back to Main and Create Feature-2 Branch:

bash
Copy code
git checkout main
git checkout -b feature-2
Make Changes on Feature-2:

bash
Copy code
echo "Feature 2 content" > feature2.txt
git add feature2.txt
git commit -m "Feature-2: Added feature2.txt"
Push Both Feature Branches to Remote:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature-1
git push origin feature-2
Create Pull Requests (PRs):

Go to the repository on GitHub.
Create PRs for feature-1 and feature-2 to merge into main.
Review and Update Feature Branches: Before merging, update the branches:

bash
Copy code
git checkout feature-1
git fetch origin
git rebase main
git push --force
Repeat for feature-2:

bash
Copy code
git checkout feature-2
git fetch origin
git rebase main
git push --force
Merge Pull Requests:

On GitHub, merge feature-1 PR into main.
Update feature-2 with the latest changes from main:
bash
Copy code
git checkout feature-2
git pull origin main
git push
Merge feature-2 PR into main.
Check Commit History: Verify the commit history is linear:

bash
Copy code
git log --oneline --graph --all
Delete Merged Branches Locally and Remotely:

bash
Copy code
git branch -d feature-1
git branch -d feature-2
git push origin --delete feature-1
git push origin --delete feature-2
Update README.md with Commands: Add the above commands into README.md under a section like "Commands Used". Then commit and push:
